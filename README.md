Compare different available modes of transportation easily, including Uber time and price estimates. Find the most efficient way to travel from point A to point B. Perfect for the city, when there are multiple means to choose from and you're not sure how to make the best use of your time.

This project started as a way to make my own life in San Francisco a little easier, and was a great excuse to learn Objective-C and the iOS SDK from scratch. Mobile development was something I've always been curious about, and as my very first published app, I had a ton of fun just learning and tinkering around with this.

Utilizes the GoogleMaps and Uber APIs.
